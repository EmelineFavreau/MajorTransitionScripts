### Tips for collaborative scripts:
- [implement automated code testing](https://github.com/EmelineFavreau/MajorTransitionScripts/blob/master/Learning-about-unit-testing.md) is important when we write together

### Nextflow pipeline
- scripts to start using [Nextflow](https://github.com/EmelineFavreau/MajorTransitionScripts/tree/master/nextflow-start), and notes to learn as we go

- scripts for our [comparative transcriptomics analyses](https://github.com/EmelineFavreau/MajorTransitionScripts/tree/master/comparative-transcriptomics), each species will be updated as it goes through Nextflow QC pipeline
