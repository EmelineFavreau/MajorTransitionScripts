## Context & Citation
This repository contains all scripts used for the 6-species transcriptomics analysis of rudimentary social species of wasps and bees, led by Dr Katherine Geist and Dr Emeline Favreau. This was developed as part of a NERC and NSF-funded project implemented in three research teams: Seirian Sumner's lab at University College London, Amy Toth's lab at Iowa State University and Sandra Rehan's lab at York University. Findings are in a submitted manuscript to Genome Biology & Evolution.
