## Raw reads of Liostenogaster flavolineata from Sumner lab
# Sampling method
Frasers Hill, Malaysia between January and April 2017 (permit reference UPE 40/200/19/3379). 


NERC Grant Objective 1 included manipulation by removing wasps in each nest to keep the nest around 4 individuals. It produced the following samples stored in RNALater: 
- **9 social foragers** (not inseminated, no developped ovaries)
- 8 solitary repoductives (inseminated, was laying eggs)
- **9 social reproductives** (the original egg-laying wasp was removed from the nest, and the next in rank wasp was inseminated and was laying eggs when sampled)
- 9 solitary foragers (inseminated, had eggs in their nests)
