## Objective: Searching for social toolkit using machine learning algorithms

# make one file with samples in columns, orthogroups in rows, read counts as values
# if a species does not have the orthogroup, the read count for that orthogroup is 10
Rscript make-input-file-for-svm.R

# test between radial and linear kernel (radial had better accuracy rate)
Rscript kernel-selection.R

# running svm on 5-species training set, and on lineage-specific training set
qsub running-svm-job-Caus.sh
qsub running-svm-job-Caus-bee-only.sh

# blast result
qsub blast-predictor-genes.sh
