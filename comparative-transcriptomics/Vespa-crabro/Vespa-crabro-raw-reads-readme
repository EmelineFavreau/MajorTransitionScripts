# Sample content (individual, or n pooled)
- 10 worker pools: first five (W1-W5) contain 4 brains, second five (W6-W10) contain 3 brains. each brain from unique geographical sampling (ie pools are homogenous in terms of allelic variation)
- 10 gyne pools: each containing 4 brains, each brain from unique geographical sampling (ie pools are homogenous in terms of allelic variation)
- 2 queen individual sample

# Total number of samples
22 samples

# Number of samples for reproductives
2 queen samples, with ovary development, evidence of inseminated (50-120 eggs in each)
VcQ1, VcQ2

10 gyne samples, with ovary development, no evidence of being inseminated, 50-100 eggs in eacg
VcG1, VcG2, ... VcG10

# Number of samples for non-reproductives
10 worker samples, with no ovary development, evidence of no egg nor being inseminated
